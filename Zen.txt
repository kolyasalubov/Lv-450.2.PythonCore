1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
2. Explicit is better than implicit.
3. Simple is better than complex.
4.Complex is better than complicated.
5.Flat is better than nested.
6.Sparse is better than dense.
7.Readability counts.
8.If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
9.Although practicality beats purity.
10. Errors should never pass silently.
11. Unless explicitly silenced.
12.In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
14. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
15. Now is better than never.
18. This is line 18
21. This is line 21
22. This is line 22 
23. This is line 23
25. There were 25 bananas
